Welcome to Downtime!
<br><br>
Downtime is an online resource for tabletop gaming in situations where your group can't always meet. Modern gaming presents challenges of distance, scheduling, and outside obligations that make getting together on a consistent basis difficult, to say the least. In a group of five or more adults, the odds that at least one member (or more) will miss any given session is almost guaranteed. In those situations, look to Downtime. 
<br><br>
Downtime allows GMs and players to have an asynchronous meeting spot for text-only gaming, specifically for scenes involving "downtime" during the story. Maybe one player wants to research the certain spell, upgrade that weapon, or work out the intricacies of castle-building and kingdom-running - things that would normally eat up precious live-gaming time. Maybe a character is involved in a secret romance better kept out of the spotlight. Perhaps there is hidden intrigue afoot...
<br><Br>
Whatever the reason, Downtime lets gamers keep up-to-date on any background story while in the midst of their own "adult" work.
<br><br>
Log in, begin a new campaign and storyline, and invite your friends. It's that easy.
